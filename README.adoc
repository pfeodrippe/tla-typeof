= TLA Edn Usage

Here we are going to create a new operator based on
link:https://twitter.com/lemmster/status/1365024900465893376?s=20[this iteraction
between @lemmy and @hwayne] called `TypeOf`. It will be a quick discussion.

You should know at least a little bit of TLA+. For Clojure, there are toons of documentation
over there, so feel free to read them.

This will be an overrided operator using link:https://github.com/pfeodrippe/tla-edn[tla-edn]
which returns the value type (just a string here). Of course, for such an simple example,
you could use Java with no problem, but we want to show the usage, so keep your disbelief
suspended for now.

Start the REPL and evaluate the `spec/run` line inside `comment`, you should have something like

If you look at the example module used link:Example/Eita.tla[Eita.tla], you will
see that it prints the types of the map `x` (see the `ALIAS` in the config file),
`"a"` keeps switching its type, first it's a Integer, then a String, back to
Integer etc and you can see it in the output.

You can also use it outside the REPL, for it you `make build` (make sure that you had
run it with the REPL to generate the classes) which generates `target/tla-typeof.jar`.
Enter in the `Example` folder and run

[source, bash]

# `TLA-EDN-Namespaces` is a system property where you say the namespaces that you want
# to use. The classes are generated based on these namespaces. We could insert some file
# while building which would contain these classes, but let's not be so clever for now.
java -cp /path/to/tlc:../target/tla-typeof.jar -DTLA-EDN-Namespaces=tla-typeof.core tlc2.TLC Eita

Yes, the jar is huge (~ 5.5 MB), but for a toy example and using Clojure, I don't
care about it here (and who cares about size nowadays regarding libraries (outside
the browser, of course)?)
